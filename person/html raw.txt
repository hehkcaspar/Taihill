                    <h4>Vice President @ U.S.-China Health Summit </h4>
                    <p>
                        The U.S.-China Health Summit is dedicated to the advancement of global health by promoting the exchange of knowledge, idea, and experiences of healthcare leaders 
                        from the US, China, and other countries through high-level strategic dialogues, leadership development programs, and applied research.<br>
                        Initiated by Yuanli Liu, Director of "Harvard China Initiative," and Dr. Jing Ma, Professor at Harvard Medical School, the Summit was 
                        inaugurated at Harvard University in September 2011. Sherry Glied, Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation at the U.S. Department
                        of Health and Human Services, and Zhu Chen, Chinese Minister of Health, attended the conference and delivered important keynote speeches.<br>

                        Since 2020, the Summit has been hosting online seminars and publishing reports in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.<br>
                        It's currently in hibernation due to the geopolitical complexity between US and China.
